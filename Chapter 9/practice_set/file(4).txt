the ####, a strong ####, walked slowly while another #### followed.
#### milk comes from a ####, and every #### has its own charm.
a #### brayed loudly, and the other ####s laughed at the ####â€™s noise.
that #### is stubborn, but the little #### beside it is a playful ####.
#### carts, #### paths, and #### herds filled the village with #### sounds.
children cheered as the #### ran, and the baby #### joined the #### race.
the farmer fed the ####, cleaned the ####, and patted the #### fondly.
under the tree, the #### rested while the other #### and #### foal played.
every #### knew the path, every #### obeyed the farmer, and every #### stayed calm.
by sunset, the ####, the #### friends, and the tiny #### foal slept peacefully.
